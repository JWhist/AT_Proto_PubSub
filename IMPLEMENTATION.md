# Implementation Summary

## What was implemented

A fully functional AT Protocol firehose filter server with HTTP API for dynamic filter management:

### Core Features
1. **Firehose Connection**: Connects to the AT Protocol firehose at `wss://bsky.network`
2. **HTTP API Server**: REST API endpoints for managing filters on port 8080
3. **Multi-Layer Filtering**: 
   - Repository filtering by DID 
   - Path prefix filtering by operation collection/path
   - Keyword filtering by text content
4. **Dynamic Filter Updates**: All filters can be updated in real-time via API
5. **Thread-Safe Operations**: Safe concurrent access to filter settings using Go's sync.RWMutex
6. **Event Logging**: Logs matching events to the console with detailed information

### Technical Implementation
- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Architecture**: Concurrent design with separate goroutines for API server and firehose connection
- **Dependencies**:
  - `github.com/gorilla/websocket` - For WebSocket connection and communication
  - Standard library packages for HTTP server, JSON handling, and concurrency
- **API Framework**: Native Go HTTP server with custom routing
- **Thread Safety**: Uses sync.RWMutex for safe concurrent filter access
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with graceful shutdown and connection retry logic

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/status` - Get server status and current filters
- `GET /api/filters` - Get current filter settings
- `POST /api/filters/update` - Update filters (supports partial updates)
- `GET /` - API documentation and available endpoints

### Key Architecture Benefits of Reorganized Structure
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between API, firehose, and data models
2. **Standard Go Layout**: Follows Go community conventions with `cmd/` and `internal/` directories
3. **Maintainability**: Modular code structure makes it easier to modify and extend
4. **Testability**: Each package can be tested independently
5. **Reusability**: Internal packages can be imported and reused
6. **Build Automation**: Makefile provides consistent build commands and cross-compilation

### Go Project Structure Conventions Used
- **`cmd/`**: Main applications for this project (entry points)
- **`internal/`**: Private application and library code (not importable by other projects)
- **`internal/api/`**: HTTP API server and handlers
- **`internal/firehose/`**: AT Protocol firehose client logic
- **`internal/models/`**: Shared data types and structures
- **`examples/`**: Example programs and demos

### Usage Examples

#### Start the server
```bash
make run
# Or: go run ./cmd/atp-test
```

#### Build and run
```bash
make build && ./atp-test
```

#### Get current status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/status
```

#### Update filters via API
```bash
# Set repository filter (filter by account DID)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repository":"did:plc:abc123xyz"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/filters/update

# Set path prefix filter (filter by operation type)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"pathPrefix":"app.bsky.feed.post"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/filters/update

# Set keyword filter
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"keyword":"hello"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/filters/update

# Set all filters together
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repository":"did:plc:abc123xyz","pathPrefix":"app.bsky.feed","keyword":"test"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/filters/update
```

### Event Output Format
Each matching event is displayed with:
- ISO timestamp
- Event type (CREATE or UPDATE)
- Repository DID
- Collection name
- Record key
- Full AT URI
- Text content
- Additional metadata (replies, languages, etc.)

### Key Go Features Used
- **Goroutines**: For concurrent handling of API server and firehose connection
- **Context**: For proper cancellation and timeout handling across services
- **Channels**: For signal handling and graceful shutdown coordination
- **Struct tags**: For JSON marshaling/unmarshaling of AT Protocol events and API requests/responses
- **Interface{}**: For handling dynamic JSON structures from AT Protocol records
- **HTTP Server**: Native Go HTTP server for REST API endpoints
- **Mutex/RWMutex**: For thread-safe access to shared filter state
- **Pointer fields**: For optional JSON fields in API requests (using *string)

### Performance Benefits of Go API Version
- **Compiled binary**: Single executable with no runtime dependencies
- **Efficient concurrency**: Goroutines for handling API requests and firehose simultaneously
- **Low memory usage**: Go's garbage collector and efficient memory management
- **Fast startup**: Compiled code starts much faster than interpreted languages
- **Cross-platform**: Easy compilation for different operating systems and architectures  
- **Thread-safe**: Safe concurrent access to shared state using Go's sync primitives
- **Real-time updates**: Filters can be changed dynamically without server restart

### Testing
- Built and compiled successfully with Go
- HTTP API endpoints tested with curl commands
- Thread-safe filter updates verified
- Partial filter updates (updating only keyword or repository) working correctly
- WebSocket connection logic implemented with gorilla/websocket
- Filter logic demonstrated with example program
- Graceful shutdown with signal handling verified for both API and firehose services
- JSON request/response handling verified

### Notes
- The server requires internet connectivity to connect to the Bluesky firehose
- API server runs on port 8080 by default
- Filters start empty (no filtering) and must be set via API calls
- In sandboxed environments without internet, the firehose connection will fail but API will remain functional
- The filtering logic is implemented correctly and can be tested offline using `make example`
- All code follows Go best practices with proper error handling, concurrent design, and RESTful API patterns
- Graceful shutdown is handled via SIGINT and SIGTERM signals using Go's signal package
- The Go API implementation provides more flexibility and better integration capabilities than the CLI version
